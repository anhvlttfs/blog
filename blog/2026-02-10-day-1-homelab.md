This is the day zero of **TheFlightSims Challenge** - A 10-day challenge to set up a full-stack enterprise network at home, with Microsoft Active Directory, DevOps, and so on.

## Set up new operating system on bare metal

### Download & install new OPNSense instance on router

From the official page, you can download new instance of OPNSense.

I recommend using a VGA image (if your router doesn't support a serial interface). You can connect the monitor to the router via the HDMI port and let it output the image for you.
